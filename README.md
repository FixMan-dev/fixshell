# FixShell v0.1.3 - Deterministic DevOps Orchestration Engine

FixShell is a secure, state-aware orchestration engine that transforms terminal failures into guided, self-healing workflows. In the 2026 edition, we prioritize **Security First** and **User Visibility**.

## 🛡️ Safety & Security (2026 Edition)
- **Zero Blind Execution**: No privileged command (sudo, apt, curl) ever runs without your explicit approval.
- **Full Transparency**: Every step shows the **Purpose** and **Risk Level** before you authorize it.
- **Live Streaming**: All installation outputs are streamed in real-time so you see exactly what's happening.

## 🐳 Docker Lifecycle Management (Feb 2026 Standards)
- **Ubuntu Official Support**:
  - Questing (25.10)
  - Noble (24.04 LTS)
  - Jammy (22.04 LTS)
- **Advanced Validation**: Detects architectural mismatches (amd64/arm64) and unsupported codenames with safe fallback options.
- **Modern Repositories**: Uses the secure `deb822` source format with dedicated GPG keyrings.
